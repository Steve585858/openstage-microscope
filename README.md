## About the Project

In a modern day lab, a microscope is required for any high end analysis. Different types of microscopes require different build materials, code, and other aspects. At the University of North Texas, Dr. Hao Yan of the Chemistry Department required a motorized microscope to analyze certain objects. His team was able to code a working GUI that allowed him to control the motors in all three dimentions, setup three working stepper motors, and connect the code and motors together. This repository contains the code that they have developed.
